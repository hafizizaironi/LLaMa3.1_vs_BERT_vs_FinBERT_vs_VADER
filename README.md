the objectives is the compare the performance between VADER, BERT, FinBERT and LLaMa 3.1 

the dataset provided by azmina binti zamani  thankfuly, helping my research.

this is not the full finished project, just updating on what is happening, because i think this is one of the important findings i have made.

the expected product : a web-based cryptocurrency price tracking system prepared with sentiment analysis on real-time news that is happening everyday from yahoo news API.

and thank god , i found LM Studio for making this happened.

LM Studio is an LLM support GUI application that make LLM run locally happening like ollama, but LM Studio make it easier to handle llama 3.1 and by the time im posting this, llama 3.2 is already came out.
